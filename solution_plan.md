# Solution Plan for add_transfers! Implementation

## Selected Hypothesis
From our error analysis, we've selected Hypothesis #1: "PromptingTools requires named functions for proper signature extraction"

## Evidence Supporting This Choice
1. Error occurs in `get_function` and `extract_docstring` methods
2. The specific error (`UndefVarError: #40 not defined`) suggests PromptingTools can't access the function definition
3. User's earlier hint about function signatures being important
4. PromptingTools documentation suggesting it needs proper function signatures

## Implementation Plan
1. Define a module-level function for transfers:
```julia
function transfer_to_agent(handover_message::String, target_name::Symbol)
    return AgentRef(target_name)
end
```

2. Modify add_transfers! to use this function:
```julia
# Create tool with proper function
tool = Tool(
    transfer_to_agent;  # Use the named function
    name=function_name,
    docs="Transfer conversation to $target_name. Requires handover_message::String to explain the reason for transfer."
)
```

3. Expected Benefits:
- PromptingTools can properly inspect the function signature
- Type information is explicit
- Handover message parameter is clearly defined
- No closure complexity

## Testing Strategy
1. Verify function naming convention test passes
2. Confirm handover message is properly handled
3. Test end-to-end agent transfers
4. Check tool signature extraction works

## Risks and Mitigations
- Risk: Multiple transfer functions might conflict
- Mitigation: Use unique function names or a single parameterized function

## Next Steps
1. Implement the solution
2. Run tests to verify
3. If tests still fail, move to next most likely hypothesis
