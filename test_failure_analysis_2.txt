Test Failure Analysis - UndefVarError: Models

Error:
- UndefVarError: Models not defined
- Occurs in utils.jl when calling PromptingTools.Models.clear_registry!()
- All other PromptingTools imports work correctly

Hypotheses:
1. Models submodule might not be properly exported from PromptingTools
2. We might need to use a different approach to access the Models submodule
3. The package version might not include the Models submodule
4. The precompilation issue might be related to circular dependencies

Investigation Steps:
1. Check PromptingTools documentation for proper Models usage
2. Verify if Models is available in REPL with proper imports
3. Check if clear_registry! is available through main module
4. Consider alternative cleanup approaches if Models access isn't possible

Potential Solutions:
1. Use alternative cleanup method if available
2. Import Models specifically from correct location
3. Update to specific PromptingTools version known to work
4. Modify test to use different cleanup approach

Next Steps:
1. Test Models availability in REPL
2. Check PromptingTools source for Models export
3. Consider alternative cleanup strategies
4. Document findings and implement solution
